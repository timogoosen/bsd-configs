# Configs for FreeBSD and OpenBSD:

This is my configs that I reuse on servers.
Looking into getting ansible to start deploying these type of
configs to FreeBSD, havn't figured out how to use Ansible with OpenBSD yet.


So far I only have FreeBSD configs, have a look at the README.md
in freebsd/ for more info.


Feel free to create an issue if you have any input.
